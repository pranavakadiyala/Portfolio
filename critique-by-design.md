# Critique by Re-design

# Step 1: Choosing a visualization to critique

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="c596945a-abfc-4716-b74c-3fb79b0ab299" data-type="interactive" data-title="State Education Budgets 2020-21 &amp;amp; 2021-22"></div><script>!function(e,n,i,s){var d="InfogramEmbeds";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>

Further, the closeness of the bars makes it extremely difficult to different the data amongst various states. 

# Step 2: Critique

I follow the critiquing structure presenting by Stephen Few. I use the 0-10 scale to score the above visual across the informative and emotive parameters presenting by Mr Few.
