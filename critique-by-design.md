# Critique by Re-design

# Step 1: Choosing a visualization to critique

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="c596945a-abfc-4716-b74c-3fb79b0ab299" data-type="interactive" data-title="State Education Budgets 2020-21 &amp;amp; 2021-22"></div><script>!function(e,n,i,s){var d="InfogramEmbeds";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>

I am critiquing this above data visual. It is from a [article](https://www.indiaspend.com/data-viz/12-states-reduced-education-funding-in-percentage-terms-803541) on a major Indian news publishing website. The article is broadly referring to the reduction in education funding across many Indian states in 21-22 compared to pre pandemic rates. I am choosing to critique this particular visualization because right off the bat, it is difficult to see what the major take-away from the visual is; ie the visual lacks a clear message. Further, the closeness of the bars makes it extremely difficult to different the data amongst various states. 

# Step 2: Critique

I follow the critiquing structure presenting by Stephen Few. I use the 0-10 scale to score the above visual across the informative and emotive parameters presenting by Mr Few.

### Usefullness - 9
The graph includes useful information on its own and defintely relevant to the audience. However, its representation is not exaclty appropriate for the claims made in the article.

### Completeness - 9
The graph has all the relevant data and complete information but not necesarily in relation to the entire article.

### Perceptibility - 2
The perceptibility is extremely bad even if the  visual doesn't use any illogical comparisions. The lack of spacing between the grouped bar graphs for each state makes it extremely difficult to seperate the appropriate budget estimates for each state. Since also the article is talking about chnage over time, the reader has to make % change calculations in their head while switching between tabs. 

### Truthfulness - 10
There is no misrepresentation of data

### Intuitiveness - 8
The graph used is a bar, which a lot of people are familiar with, hence making it easy to understand. However, switching between the tabs to glean full information may be a new functionality that someone is not used to and therefore not immediately intuitive. 

### Aesthetics - 3
The aesthetics are not terrible at first sight, but honestly not helping in any way with comprehension. 

### Engagement - 5
The visual is confusing, so its not really distracting from the data nor are the audience being drawn to it. Its mostly confusing. 

Overall my perception of the data visual is the following:
At first glance, the visual seems ok. The colors are not too jarring and a bar graph, one of the most familiar graphs is used. Hence, the visual is not too complicated. 

However, the message is not clear and the bar graphs are not designed for easy comprehension. There is no space between grouped bars and its a bit straining to segregate the bars. I had to jump between multiple graphs and multiple tabs to see if I could see the trends referenced in the article. And often the claims could not exactly be corroborated.

I would add more space between graphs and represent changes in % change terms. It's also hard to see changes over the three estimates, I would instead try to represent them together. 

# Step 3: Sketch out a solution

For the initial sketches I generated three. They are shown below in the order in which they were generated. I sought feedback on all three of them simultaneously. 

I ended up generating three graphs because I wasn't happy with any particular graph entirely. While one graph fixed some issues others, it couldn't tackle other issues. 

#### Sketch 1
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/15078966"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I generated this visual with the intention to highlight all three percentage changes in the same visual. It also fixes the issue with spacing between graphs. However, I wasn't fully happy because its not entirely clear if the data corroborates the title and the overall message in the article. 

#### Sketch 2
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/15080132"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

Seeing trends in the previous graph was difficulty. In fact having all three values in the same graph made it more confusing so I split them across three tabs.

#### Sketch 3
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-slope" data-src="visualisation/15079829"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

I felt a clear take-away or message was missing in the previous graphs and additional work was needed by reader to interpret. The article highlighted Assam and Tamil Nadu (two states in India) for reducing their budgets and spending overtime, which could be the main message. However, that assessment is not entirely correct as only Tamil Nadu truly reduced both its actual spending in 20-21 and also budget estimates for 21-22 comapred to 20-21. Hence I generated the above visual.

# Step 4: Test the solution

I test all three sketches by speaking with 3 individuals, in their late and mid 20s. I use the questions highlighted in instructions with slight modifications:
1. Can you tell me what you think this is?
2. What is the main take-away or message?
3. Anything that stands out to you?
4. Anything that is confusing?
5. Who is the audience?
6. What would you change?

### Sketch 1 feedback:
While it was clear from the title that the graph related to education govt budget and spending, additional explanation was required to understand the meaning of Revised Estimates (RE) and Budget Estimates (BE) metrics.

It was also felt that title doesn't corraborate with the graph because the data didn't seem to indicate there was such a big fall in education budget or spending. 

Looking at three different, not so obvious % change metrics was confusing. Kerala stood out because of big graphs. 

Majority thought that the government or education policy interest groups were the main audience. General Indian population was also mentioned to be the audience - for general awareness. 

Some important and relevant changes suggested - split up the graphs and highlight some states.

### Sketch 2 feedback:
It was much quickly comprehended - could be because the important data labels were already explained. However, the major pro was how quickly trends were identified both within each tab and also overall. The overall message was understood to mean - almost all states were increased budget in 21-22 based on previous year spending - except Assam and TN. Assam also stands out in the first tab visual as the only state spending more than budgeted. 

There was a consensus that this graph was better than the previous in terms of ease of comprehension.

Audience was considered to be the same and no major changes were recommended. 

### Sketch 3 feedback:
Everyone thought this was the clearest graph with one big takeway - the flat line for Tamil Nadu. The slight marginal decrease was barely noticable and not considered super important. 

The other background values even though fade into the background - also indicate not so bad budget allocation in 21-22 for majority states. 

A change suggested by one individual - move the gridlines closer to make the slope more titled for Tamil Nadu.

One reviewer browsed over other states and saw Assam was the only one who increased actual spending in 20-21 (again probably following from the learnings made in sketch 2). 

One important feedback was that this graph only highlighted Tamil Nadu - which did not even seem that interesting - and sort of disgregarded more informative trends in other states, which I completely agree with. 

### Refocusing on the main takeaway
From the feedback and upon reading the aritcle more closely, its important to also show trends education budget as a % of overall budget. With just the above data, it would appear that majority of the state governments are interested in increasing education budgets. However, its more nuanced becasue education is actually now a lower share of overall budget - showing 

This is represented by two different graphs, making it annoying anf frustrating to cross reference.
