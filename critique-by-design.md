# Critique by Re-design

# Step 1: Choosing a visualization to critique

<div class="infogram-embed" data-id="c596945a-abfc-4716-b74c-3fb79b0ab299" data-type="interactive" data-title="State Education Budgets 2020-21 &amp;amp; 2021-22"></div><script>!function(e,n,i,s){var d="InfogramEmbeds";var o=e.getElementsByTagName(n)[0];if(window[d]&&window[d].initialized)window[d].process&&window[d].process();else if(!e.getElementById(i)){var r=e.createElement(n);r.async=1,r.id=i,r.src=s,o.parentNode.insertBefore(r,o)}}(document,"script","infogram-async","https://infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js");</script>


I am critiquing this above data visual. It is from a [article](https://www.indiaspend.com/data-viz/12-states-reduced-education-funding-in-percentage-terms-803541) on a major Indian news publishing website. The article is broadly referring to the reduction in education funding across many Indian states in 21-22 compared to pre pandemic rates. I am choosing to critique this particular visualization because right off the bat, it is difficult to see what the major take-away from the visual is; ie the visual lacks a clear message. Further, the closeness of the bars makes it extremely difficult to different the data amongst various states. 

# Step 2: Critique

I follow the critiquing structure presenting by Stephen Few. I use the 0-10 scale to score the above visual across the informative and emotive parameters presenting by Mr Few.

### Usefullness - 9
The graph includes useful information on its own and defintely relevant to the audience. However, its representation is not exaclty appropriate for the claims made in the article.

### Completeness - 9
The graph has all the relevant data and complete information but not necesarily in relation to the entire article.

### Perceptibility - 2
The perceptibility is extremely bad even if the  visual doesn't use any illogical comparisions. The lack of spacing between the grouped bar graphs for each state makes it extremely difficult to seperate the appropriate budget estimates for each state. Since also the article is talking about chnage over time, the reader has to make % change calculations in their head while switching between tabs. 

### Truthfulness - 10
There is no misrepresentation of data

### Intuitiveness - 8
The graph used is a bar, which a lot of people are familiar with, hence making it easy to understand. However, switching between the tabs to glean full information may be a new functionality that someone is not used to and therefore not immediately intuitive. 

### Aesthetics - 3
The aesthetics are not terrible at first sight, but honestly not helping in any way with comprehension. 

### Engagement - 5
The visual is confusing, so its not really distracting from the data nor are the audience being drawn to it. Its mostly confusing.

In this visualization, I tried to
Better - change in terms of percentage, space between graphs
But same issue about whats the approppriate change

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/15080132"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-slope" data-src="visualisation/15079829"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
