# Visualizing Government Debt

## Debt-to-GDP Ratio in OECD countries (2019)

The following visualization shows the debt to GDP percent of OECD countries in addition to few other countries for year 2019.

Why this visualization:
- I was interested in three major variables: time, individual Nordic OECD countries and debt-gdpt ratio. The obvious choice would have been a line graph. However, that would require a rainbow of colours for each country (and benchmarked average of other European countries). However, rainboe graphs can be dostracting and instead wanted to use color to focus on the debt-gdp ratio change over time.
- This beeswarm graph limits the use of color by presenting the data points for each category on a gride that mimics a number line. This helps with ease 

Visualization methods:
- color and limitting eyetravel
- reducing redundancy
- aligning everything according to common conventions
