# About me
<img src="Pranava_Kadiyala_Potograph.jpeg" width="200"/>

Hello! I'm a graduate student at CMU with a strong passion for leveraging Data Science for Social Good. I'm deeply motivated by the transformative power of data-driven insights in shaping effective policy. My enthusiasm lies in working with data, harnessing its potential, and crafting meaningful visualizations that drive informed policy actions.

# What I hope to learn

1. Understanding how to create impactful visualizations - work with color, identify good visulizations and limit clutter to emphasize important data points. 
2. Get comfortable using GitHub and develop a strong portfolio.
3. Learn how to use Tableau and other visualization software.
