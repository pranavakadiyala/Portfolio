# Changes made since Part II

* Defining the story arc and fleshing out the narrative:  In response to Part 2 feedback that the story arc was confusing and the narrative felt limited, significant revisions were made. The revised narrative now begins with an introduction to the initial COVID-19 timeline, which eventually led to two years of school closures, during which most learning took place online. The narrative then highlights data points where teachers and schools reported challenges in functioning at full capacity, potentially resulting in learning loss. The story arc transitions to how credible data in 2022 confirms these losses, with long-term impacts according to experts. The final discussion on interventions introduces the audience to successful policies aimed at addressing these losses, guiding the audience to plan the next steps; identifying effective tutoring frameworks.

* Improving on charts: Addressing feedback on the effectiveness of the initial map displaying school closures, it was omitted due to limitations with Tableau and the map animation. Additionally, feedback on later graphs displaying learning scores and resource access being pixelated prompted a switch to embedding graphs for the final project. The Gantt chart from Tableau now includes additional context to better connect with the rest of the story and emphasizes the significant data point that most children were learning online during the two year period. 

* Focusing on the audience and CTAs: I consciously chose to focus on parents because, while they may have noticed that not much learning happened during the pandemic, they often lack information about the extent of learning loss, its long-term impacts, and expert perspectives. Therefore, the latter part of the content was aimed at bridging this information gap. I refined the Calls to Action (CTAs) to provide specific guidance for parents on how they can support their children effectively. The challenge with this topic is that achieving large-scale positive impacts requires systemic policy interventions, which can be challenging for individual parents to take on. However, since my previous CTAs were somewhat vague and not necessarily tailored to parents, I delved deeper into how individual parents can take immediate steps that might contribute and support future systemic policy changes.

## The audience

I had many iterations of who my main audience should be - parents/students, teachers or policy makers or all. The problem with having all these is they have different access to data and understanding of the problem and also can have opposing preferences. For example teachers largely didn't want to come back to in person teaching when the whole debate about online and in person teaching was going on in 2021. Hence I concentrated on the group parents who probably currently have lesser data on such learning loss. Hence the story is intended to be impactful but not too statistically heavy handed. 

## Final design decisions

When I decided to target parents and students as the primary audience for the story, I recognized that these key stakeholders might not always have the most up-to-date information due to information asymmetry. Therefore, my aim was to create an impactful narrative without overwhelming them with statistical jargon. To achieve this, I adopted a dark theme with minimal text and jargon, choosing instead to emphasize essential data points through callouts and straightforward charts. I intentionally avoided complex chart types like sankey or spider charts, opting for familiar, easy-to-understand visual representations.

# Final thoughts

Working on this project allowed me to delve into the art of crafting a narrative, which was not a primary focus in my previous job, despite my experience with data. It introduced me to a highly effective and powerful framework for organizing and presenting data. I was particularly enthusiastic about exploring the topic of learning loss and the related discourse in the United States. Having worked extensively in the field of education in India, I was familiar with the issues and how to identify reliable data and sources there. However, adapting to the U.S. context presented a steep learning curve. I found great satisfaction in reading academic texts, extracting vital information, and presenting it in an easily digestible format. In the future, I aim to focus on developing effective presentation structures that facilitate informative knowledge sharing.
