# Wireframes / storyboards

For this project, I aim to emphasize the significant learning deficit experienced by students in the US even as they were continuing to learn via remote education. Measuring and analyzing this learning loss and exploring strategies for improvement will help identify ways to update the existing approach for more effective outcomes.

As I was working on the project, I generated a new story arc that update on last week's submission. It has been updated keeping in mind the comments left by the instructor and data availability with the aim to develop a more targetted narrative and to develop a clear call to action. 

The story arc:


# User research 

## Target audience

As mentioned in [part 1](final-project-part-one), there are three main audience for this story, in addition to the general audience who are regular news consumers and would be interested in knowing COVD-19's impact on education. 

Target audience:
* Parents/current students
* Teachers and government school officials
* Policy makers

However, I was unable to contact individuals with the above identifiable characteristics. Instead I spoke with 3 individuals in their mid and late 20s who completed their elementary, secondary and high school education in the US. Both of them also completed their undergrad during COVID-19 and hence actively learnt using online methods. One of them also has a sibling who is currently in high school and was just beggining high school in 2020. Further, both of them worked with state and local governments on policy implementation questions. 

Hence, I feel like the two stakeholders - parents/current studetns
