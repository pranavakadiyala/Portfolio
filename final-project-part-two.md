# Wireframes / storyboards

For this project, I aim to emphasize the significant learning deficit experienced by students in the US even as they were continuing to learn via remote education. Measuring and analyzing this learning loss and exploring strategies for improvement will help identify ways to update the existing approach for more effective outcomes.

As I was working on the project, I generated a new story arc that updates on last week's submission. It has been updated keeping in mind the comments left by the instructor and data availability with the aim to develop a more targetted narrative and to develop a clear call to action. 

The story arc:

# User research 

## Target audience

As mentioned in [part 1](final-project-part-one), there are three main audience for this story, in addition to the general audience who are regular news consumers and would be interested in knowing COVD-19's impact on education. 

Target audience:
* Parents/current students
* Teachers and government school officials
* Policy makers

However, I was unable to contact individuals with the above identifiable characteristics. Instead, I spoke with 3 individuals in their mid and late 20s who completed their elementary, secondary and high school education in the US. Two of them also completed their undergrad during COVID-19 and hence actively learnt using online methods. One of them also has a sibling who is currently in high school and was just beginning high school in 2020. Further, two of them worked with state and local governments on policy implementation questions. 

Hence, I feel like the two stakeholders - parents/current studetns and policy makers have been decently represented by the interviewees. However, as outlined in [part 1](final-project-part-one), since teachers have very similar goals and interests, I belive that overall the interviewers' feedback is pretty comprehensive and quite representative. 

## Interview script

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| The story follows a narrative   | Do you think the storyboard follows a story?              |
| The graphs/visualizations are relevant    | Do you think the choice of charts and variables represented is relevant and appropriate?               |
| The message is clear    | What is the main take-away or message?                 |
| The story is relevant for the audeience  | Who do you think is the audience of this story? |
| Direct feedback | What would you change? |
| To understand if anything is standing out - to check if what needs to be emphasized is being emphasized | Anything that stands out to you? Or is confusing? |



Script/How the interviews were conducted:
When conducting the interviews, I give very little background. I just start showing them the preview for the shorthand. If there are any questions or queries about anything - like what is the graph showing, etc, I note them down against the question or goal its connected to and answer them. After they are done scrolling, I ask them questions in the order written above. 

## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 2 (mid 20s, worked with government, attending college during covid, worked with government, has a sibling currently going to high school) | Interview 1 (late 20s, worked with local government)  | Interview 3 (early 20s, attending college during covid, interested in education policy) |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Do you think the storyboard follows a story? | Yes, overall pretty good, but when the charts about math come into the picture, its abrupt and too specific. But the initial set-up is nice            | Yes, follows a chornological order and I see discussion of cause and effect           | Yes, there seems to be a consistent theme too which is nice            |
| Do you think the choice of charts and variables represented is relevant and appropriate?                      | Add subjects, right now only talking about math. The closure duration chart, its too big and I am not able to see X-axis. I would condense to a single bar.                              | Fix map animation, make the closure duration small, while scrolling you can't see the axis for a while           | Add more subjects - need additional variables to substantiate the point about learning loss. Make comparisions more obvious - look at more historical data           |
| What is the main take-away or message?                        | Right now the main message seems to be just about learning loss in math - change the title to reflect losses in math only if thats the case | The main message about COIVD-19 related learning loss is clear.            | The main message about COVID-19 impacting learning is clear but needs substantiating - is it only math? What about other subjects?            |
| Who do you think is audience of this story? | The main audience seems to be the general public, like for a New York Times story - interactive and fun visualization for reuglar news consumers. While it could be specific for say teachers -  the data and content should reflect that - what was teachers effort like before and after pandemic, etc. Because they may not be totally on board with some of the suggestions | School administrators, parents - they have a more active role and can implement changes. The General public also seems like another big audience group | Mostly general public, need to be more specific if its referring to special groups like teachers, policy makers etc.
| What would you change? | The school closure duration graph - make it into a single bar with different colors, too big, cant see X axis immediately. Add more subjects  | Fix animation for the map, the X - axis on school closure duration is not immediately seen. The two learning outcomes graph - not clear that its two different and its changing so would fix that. Less pictures and less clutter | For the map, dates should be bigger, not clear and small. The two learning outcomes graph - the change is super subtle. Make it more highlighted. Also too many pictures - a little clutter. |
| Anything that stands out to you? Or is confusing? | The text is changing fonts, a bit distracting. The steps to recovery just appears - not sure what I can do. | Immediately - the red bar chart. But overall flows fine only | Nothing too confsuing, overall messaging fine, I would just add more to substantiate |


# Identified changes for Part III

| Research synthesis                       | Anticipated changes for Part III                                                |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Adding more subjects and looking at more historical data | I will look at more data to add learning outcome effects for other subjects too. Will also split these graphs more explicitly so that they don't merge into each other like it happened with the math graphs. I will also add aditional section between learning outcome charts and X days lost so that its not so abrupt. Right now not sure what it could but more like a leading 'slide' maybe. |
| The school closure duration graph needs updating along with the map |  The two tableau graphs need real fixing. Condense the red bar graph, reduce the size - put the X axis on top rather than the bottom and actually make the map work|
| The audeince member | I am now focusing on making this story more for a general audience - simply because specific data about teachers effort, parents preferences and effort during pandemic is difficult to get. Even so, I think the narrative structure would remain and specific enough to be engaging.  |
| Consistency with theming and background            |  Make the background dark all throughout and fix formatting issues - keep it very consistent |                                                                             |
| Steps for improvement | Substantiate these points by adding more data so that the call to action for seems fair, urgent and reasonable |
| Clutter | Reduce pictures and add more text to provide context |
