# Outline

The project analyses the continual impact of COVID-19 on school education. Beginning with the 2022 academic year, even though most schools have gone back to in person teaching, students behavioral and learning outcomes have continued to lag behind pre-COVID-19 rates. Through this project, I want to highlight how remote learning as a consequence of COVID-19 is associated with a stark decline in important student and education outcomes along with hetergenous effects across various community groups in the United States. The intention is to feature important new data on COVID-19's disruptions using a data visualization narrative style. 

### Structure

The project includes the following elements:
* Shift to remote learning
* Reduction in learning at the level - math and english
* Mental health crises
* Behavioral development
* Lingering affects

# Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data

I will rely on various data sources from the National Centre for Education Statistics (NCES) which is part of the Department of Education. NCES publishes data on education within the United States. I will primarily use the following three surveys from the NCES:
* School pulse panel data: Its a rapid response survey to collect data from government elementary, middle and high schools for the years 2019-2022 on a monthly basis. Includes data related to instruction activities, learining, mental health, behavioral outcomes, etc.
* School pre-assessment data: Data from surveys in seventh and eigth grade schools from December 2021 to february 2022 related to instuction and social distancing mandates and activities. 
* School monthly data from spring 2021: 

Further, for more recent data, I will rely on databases curated by the Covid-19 School Data Hub. It provides additional avenues for data in case of missing data points in the NCES data.

# Method and medium

For the project, I will use shorthand as my primary visual presentation. The shorthand website will host all the final analysis and data visuals. For generating the data visuals, I will use a mix of flourish and Tableau, both for the initial sktches and final data visuals. As part of my previous assignments, doing these initial sketches on flourish helped communicate the intention of the graph more clearly and get good feedback. For data cleaning, processing and analysis, I will use Python.
