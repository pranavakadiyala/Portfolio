# Outline

The project analyses the continual impact of COVID-19 on school education. Beginning with the 2022 academic year, even though most schools have gone back to in person teaching, students behavioral and learning outcomes have continued to lag behind pre-COVID-19 rates. Through this project, I want to highlight how remote learning as a result of COVID-19 is associated with a stark decline in important student and education outcomes along with hetergenous effects across various community groups in the United States. The intention is to feature important new data on COVID-19's disruptions using a data visualization narrative style. 

### Structure

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear. 

The project includes the following elements:
* Reduction in learning at the level - math and english
* Mental health crises
* Behavioral development
* School absenteeism

# Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.

# The data
> A couple of paragraphs that document your data source(s), and an explanation of how you plan on using your data. 


> A link to the publicly-accessible datasets you plan on using, or a link to a copy of the data you've uploaded to your Github repository, Box account or other publicly-accessible location. Using a datasource that is already publicly accessible is highly encouraged.  If you anticipate using a data source other than something that would be publicly available please talk to me first.
